# Photography Management & Digital Delivery Platform - Development Strategy

## Executive Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development strategy for a facial recognition-powered photography sorting and digital delivery platform. The system will automatically organize uploaded photos, generate exportable data, and provide secure client galleries with enterprise-grade compliance.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack Recommendations

**Backend:**
- **Primary Framework**: Node.js with Express or Python with Django/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching) + S3-compatible object storage
- **Queue System**: Bull/BullMQ or Celery for async processing
- **API**: RESTful with GraphQL for complex queries

**Frontend:**
- **Web Application**: React/Next.js or Vue/Nuxt for SSR capabilities
- **Mobile**: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS

**AI/ML Services:**
- **Facial Recognition**: AWS Rekognition, Azure Face API, or self-hosted with OpenCV/dlib
- **Image Processing**: Sharp (Node.js) or Pillow (Python)

## Core Modules Development Guide

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Module

```javascript
// Implementation approach
- Multi-tenant architecture with organization-level isolation
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration for social logins
- Session management with Redis
```

**Security Requirements:**
- Password complexity requirements
- MFA implementation
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Account lockout policies
- Audit logging for all authentication events

### 2. Photo Upload & Processing Pipeline

```python
# Processing workflow pseudocode
class PhotoProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.face_detector = FaceDetectionService()
        self.storage = CloudStorageService()
        
    async def process_upload(self, photo_batch):
        # 1. Validate file types and sizes
        # 2. Generate multiple resolutions
        # 3. Extract EXIF data
        # 4. Run facial detection
        # 5. Generate embeddings
        # 6. Store in appropriate buckets
        # 7. Update database records
        # 8. Trigger notification events
```

**Key Features:**
- Chunked upload for large files
- Progress tracking
- Duplicate detection via perceptual hashing
- Automatic orientation correction
- Metadata preservation

### 3. Facial Recognition Engine

**Architecture Components:**

```yaml
FaceRecognitionPipeline:
  Detection:
    - MTCNN or RetinaFace for face detection
    - Minimum face size: 80x80 pixels
    - Confidence threshold: 0.95
    
  Encoding:
    - FaceNet or ArcFace for embeddings
    - 128/512-dimensional vectors
    - Cosine similarity matching
    
  Clustering:
    - DBSCAN for automatic grouping
    - Manual verification interface
    - Merge/split capabilities
```

**Data Privacy Considerations:**
- Encryption of facial embeddings at rest
- User consent management
- Right to deletion implementation
- Anonymization options

### 4. CSV Export & Field Mapping System

```typescript
interface FieldMapping {
  photoId: string;
  detectedFaces: Face[];
  mappedData: {
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    team?: string;
    class?: string;
    division?: string;
    jerseyNumber?: string;
    teacher?: string;
    customFields: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

class CSVExporter {
  generateExport(mappings: FieldMapping[]): Buffer {
    // Implement CSV generation with:
    // - Custom field ordering
    // - Template support
    // - Bulk editing before export
    // - Version control for exports
  }
}
```

### 5. Gallery Management System

**Frontend Features Implementation:**

```javascript
// Gallery configuration schema
const galleryConfig = {
  layout: {
    type: 'grid' | 'masonry' | 'slideshow',
    columns: number,
    spacing: number,
    aspectRatio: string
  },
  security: {
    passwordProtected: boolean,
    expirationDate: Date,
    downloadEnabled: boolean,
    watermarking: boolean
  },
  branding: {
    logo: string,
    primaryColor: string,
    customCSS: string
  },
  features: {
    favorites: boolean,
    comments: boolean,
    sharing: boolean,
    purchasing: boolean
  }
};
```

**Access Control:**
- Shareable links with expiration
- Email verification for access
- IP restrictions
- Download limits
- View analytics

### 6. Mobile Application Architecture

```kotlin
// Mobile app core structure
class OfflinePhotoManager {
    private val localDB: Room.Database
    private val syncManager: WorkManager
    
    fun captureReference() {
        // 1. Capture photo with metadata
        // 2. Store locally with SQLite
        // 3. Queue for sync
        // 4. Generate local preview
    }
    
    fun syncWithServer() {
        // 1. Check connectivity
        // 2. Batch upload queued items
        // 3. Handle conflicts
        // 4. Update local state
    }
}
```

**Offline Capabilities:**
- Local SQLite database
- Background sync with conflict resolution
- Compressed local storage
- Progressive upload with resume capability

## Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Core tables structure
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(50),
    storage_quota BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
